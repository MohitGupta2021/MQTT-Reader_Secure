# MQTT-Reader_Secure
MQTT-Reader_Secure project is designed to create a secure MQTT client that communicates with an MQTT broker using SSL/TLS. This project involves setting up a Docker environment to run the Mosquitto MQTT broker and a Python application that uses the gmqtt library to subscribe to MQTT topics securely.
